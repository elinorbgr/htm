# HTM -- Hierarchical Temporal Memory

This crate aims to provide rusty implementations of HTM-related algorithms and useful tools.

It currently implements the base of the Cortical Learning Algorithm.

## Licensing

The algorithms implemented in this crate are the intellectual property of [Numenta](http://numenta.com/).

They have chosen to allow their use for research and non-commercial purposes, and also provide a framework:
[NuPIC](http://numenta.org/) under the AGPLv3 license for non-commercial use.

This crate is released under the same license. If you want to make commercial use of these algorithms, you'll need
to contact Numenta to settle things. See http://numenta.org/licenses/ for details.
